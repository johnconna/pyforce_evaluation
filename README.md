# pyforce_evaluation
## Introduction
A project for detecting malious PYPI evaluation,using OSSF/Bandit4mal/EA4MP
## 0x00 OSSF
OSSF can both dynamically or staticly analysis malious PYPI packages
### 1.Static analysis
First should install podman container environment
After successfully installed,I wrote an auto serial script to analysis PYPI one-by-one.
Why serial? Because container seems conflict
